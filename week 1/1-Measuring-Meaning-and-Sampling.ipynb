The analysis will involve examining users' tweets, likes, and retweets to observe the trends of these discussions and the social relationships formed among participants through these discussions. Furthermore, I intend to compare the performance of countries that are unable to engage in offline protests and those that are active in offline protests, with regard to their participation in online protests."

        "To gain insights into how individuals engage in online protests, I plan to analyze textual content on Twitter. The advantage of using Twitter lies in the accessibility of its API, which facilitates more convenient analysis. However, there are limitations associated with the high costs of Twitter API usage and the fact that users' tweets may only partially reflect their emotions, rhetoric, and other factors during online protests, without capturing the interplay between offline and online protest activities. Consequently, I intend to employ a combination of qualitative methods and interviews to address this research question. The significance of this study lies in its potential to assess whether online protests can serve as an effective means for populations in countries lacking offline protest environments to voice their concerns."
